## Conclusion

In conclusion, our project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning techniques in recognizing emotions from speech signals. We utilized several feature extraction methods and compared the performance of various machine learning algorithms and deep learning models. Our results showed that deep learning models, particularly the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), outperformed the traditional machine learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and F1-score. 
Additionally, our analysis of the confusion matrix revealed that the models were able to recognize certain emotions more accurately than others, indicating the need for further improvement in emotion recognition techniques
